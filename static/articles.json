The e-commerce giant on Thursday cancelled its plans to build a new headquarter in New York City following persistent criticism from local union supporters, the New York City Council and several elected officials. Amazon in November announced plans to build two 25,000-employee campuses in Long Island City, New York and in Arlington, Virginia. Both locations were chosen from more than 200 bidders and were expected to receive $2.5 billion in investments from Amazon. Since Amazon dropped the HQ2 plan in the Big Apple, several elected officials and organizations have spoken. (You can read Amazon's full statement here.) New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio 'You have to be tough to make it in New York City. We gave Amazon the opportunity to be a good neighbor and do business in the greatest city in the world. Instead of working with the community, Amazon threw away that opportunity. We have the best talent in the world and every day we are growing a stronger and fairer economy for everyone. If Amazon can't recognize what that's worth, its competitors will.'"},{"title":"Apple Earnings Short","body":"I guess they can't all be iPhones"},{"title":"Steve founds the Daily Planet","body":"Wow!
